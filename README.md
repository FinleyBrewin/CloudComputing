# CloudComputing
This coursework was for my cloud computing coursework. 
I was tasked to create a RESTful service and client to host a travel buddy application.
The user can login and submit a trip with location and date, Find already submitted trips, add interest to trips and check interest on own submitted trips. It includes API requests to find weather information and random.org to generate UUIDs.

This is a similar application to Couchsurfing, UNBLND, Travello etc.
